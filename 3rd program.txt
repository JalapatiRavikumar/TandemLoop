Take input – Read an integer a from the user.

Start with 1 – This is the first odd number.

Loop until limit – Use while (num <= a) to keep printing odd numbers within range.

Comma placement – Print a comma only if another odd number will follow.

Move to next odd number – Increase num by 2 each time.
