1st program;---
----------------

#README:-

Read Input – The program takes a as input from the user.

Start with First Odd Number – num is set to 1.

Loop through Terms – A loop runs exactly a times.

Print Each Odd Number – After printing, increase the number by 2 to get the next odd number.

Formatting – A comma is printed after each number except the last one to make the output neat.



Input: 4  
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7

3rd--program:-
-------------------
Take input – Read an integer a from the user.

Start with 1 – This is the first odd number.

Loop until limit – Use while (num <= a) to keep printing odd numbers within range.

Comma placement – Print a comma only if another odd number will follow.

Move to next odd number – Increase num by 2 each time.


4rth:-program:--
--------------------
Loop from 1 to 9 → Each i is the number you are checking multiples for.

Check each number in the array → If num % i == 0, then num is a multiple of i.

Count them → Keep track of how many numbers satisfy the condition.

Print in dictionary style → Looks like {1: 11, 2: 8, ..., 9: 1}.


When i = 2: multiples in the list are 2, 8, 12, 46, 76, 82, 20, 30 → Count = 8

When i = 5: multiples are 15, 20, 30 → Count = 3
